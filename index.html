    <h1>Here now happening</h1>
    <h2>Suddenly the pieces make sense</h2>
    <p>I am starting to enjoy the process of piecing together a website and
      thinking more free flowing about content and containment of ideas.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In all respects, the great learning is in the anticipation of
        things getting easier, the more familiar the tools become.</p>
      <br />
      <p>If I were to highlight how special it is to have fun whilst
        coding, I would say, it's like learning to ride a bike, when
        stabilisers no longer matter. My top three points would be:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li> Swimming without spluttering so much</li>
          <li> Reaching the top of a mountain for the first time</li>
          <li> Ordering coffee in a foreign language and being understood</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is one of my favorite websites: <a href="https://www.google.com"
          target="_blank">Google</a></p>
